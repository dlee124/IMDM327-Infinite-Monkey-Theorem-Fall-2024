Infinite Monkey Theorem: 

*The infinite monkey theorem holds that a monkey given an infinite amount of time at a keyboard would ultimately type out every possible text, including the complete works of Shakespeare.*

To get this project to actually run in unity, will have to get the [LLMUnity](https://github.com/undreamai/LLMUnity?tab=readme-ov-file) plugin and add it to the project

I learned mostly an implementation of llama into unity through a tutorial. It also was a small thought experiment visualized on what if complete gibberish were to be entered into a large language model, although it involved some prompt engineering because otherwise the model would respond with something along the lines of not understanding. Because the input is completely random, the responses from the model were also very unpredictable, creating a unique experience each time it is run. 

I hope the audience enjoyed seeing the small monkey type keys randomly, along with the silly 2 frame animations. I wanted to keep the project cohesive direction-wise, going for a somewhat absurdist cartoon feeling. 

For future improvements, I would like to add a small clicky sound whenever the user types something, or any sound at all. I also would have liked to make the original “gamification” elements more prominent, like adding a streak feature, but in practice, the occurrences of “hits” were so uncommon that I would have to find another way to implement it. I also could look more into the impossible probability aspect of the theorem, such as a small visualization of how long it would actually take to actually type a work accurately.
